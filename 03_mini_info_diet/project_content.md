Ingest a curated list of readings into NotebookLM (or similar) via an agent that:

Creates an audio summary, slide deck, and exportable downloads for each item.

Compile these outputs into a unified “reader” experience (web or app) that the agent keeps up to date.

Maintain a live reading-progress board where I can:

Mark items as read / unread

Express preferences with simple interactions, such as:

Thumbs up on the right

Thumbs down on the left

Swipe to skip or archive

Train a lightweight preference model that distills my likes and dislikes and:

Re-ranks the remaining reading list

(todo) Curates new items that match my inferred taste using semantic scholar after i finish the current list

Continuously updates future recommendations based on my ongoing feedback.
