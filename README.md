**Multi-Agent Debate System** — Agents debate evaluation strategies, synthesizing insights no single perspective would reach alone.

---

**Personalized Paper Recommender** — Daily curated picks from your reading list. Learns from email feedback to refine recommendations.

---

**Agentic Evaluation Synthesis** — Deep-dive covering LLM-as-judge, reward modeling, multi-turn credit assignment, and production patterns.
