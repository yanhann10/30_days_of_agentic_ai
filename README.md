## Overview

This repository documents an exploration of agent research on self-improvement, world modeling, safety-aware design, and metacognitive capabilities, along with personal exploratory project.

## Research Foundation

**[Self-Evolving Agents](01_self_evolving_agents_primer.md)**
Survey of meta-agent programming (ADAS), automated research (AI-Scientist-v2), and evolutionary multi-agent optimization (AgentBreeder). Key insight: multi-objective optimization with safety constraints outperforms pure capability maximization.

**[World Models](02_making_sense_of_world_model.md)**
Analysis of latent world models (DreamerV3/V4) and neurosymbolic augmentation (WALL-E 2.0). Focuses on RSSM architectures, posterior/prior state separation, and symbolic knowledge extraction for causal reasoning.

**[Risk Mitigation](04_risk_mitigation.md)**
Examination of safety failure modes: in-context scheming, prompt injection, reward misalignment, and context-free advice. Mitigation strategies include injection isolation (DRIFT), architectural constraints (LawZero), and MCTS-guided context acquisition.

**[Cognition for Agents](05_cognition_for_agents.md)**
Application of psychological frameworks to agent design. Theory of Mind for social reasoning (MetaMind), metacognition for introspection and strategy adaptation, and the distinction between reflection (backward) vs metacognition (forward).
